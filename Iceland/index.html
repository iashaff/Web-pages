                <h2>Iceland</h2>
                    <p>Iceland is a stunningly beautiful place if you enjoy strange and desolate landscapes. The amount of daylight varies dramatically by season. The sun sets briefly each night in June, but the sky doesn't get fully dark before the next sunrise</p>

                    <h3>Landscape</h3>
                    <p>Black-sand beaches; electric blue ice caps; dramatic fjords; volcanic craters; and endless lava fields can all be found within the country, often just a short drive from each other. Visitors to Iceland are often awed by the diversity of scenery that can be explored within a few hours, even for those staying in Reykjav√≠k going out on day tours.</p>

                        <h3>Spring in Iceland</h3>
                        <p>The botanical gardens are much more beautiful in spring than they are in summer with colourful flowers booming with bees and butterfly, the smell of the spring air is definitely fresher than you would think of.</p>

                            <h3>Northen lights</h3>
                            <p>The Northern Lights season is from late August to mid-April. However, from late September to late March, it is dark after 6 pm, and one enjoys maximum chances. On a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak in September and March. The reasons for this trend are due to the March and September equinox.</p>
